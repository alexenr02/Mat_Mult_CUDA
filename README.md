Matrix Multiplication with CUDA, openMP and Serial algorithm.

The main function is alocated in kernel.cu and the objective of the program is to obtain data from two text files, process them, and fill two matrix to make a matrix multiplication. 
The program validates the data, the memory available in the computer and in the end, prints a comparative chart with the times that each algorithm took.
